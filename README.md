# Menoni

Helps to create a CLI program with "menus" using the crossterm crate.

## Download

Download the repo using git:

```console
git clone git@github.com:PekoniIMutteri/Menoni.git
```

Then add it to your dependecies:

```toml
[dependecies]
menoni = { "path" = "<path-to-menoni>" }
```

## Roadmap

I want to get rid of that macro. Don't use macros.

But other than that, I want to be able to automatically save the data to a file,
and load that data on the next launch.
